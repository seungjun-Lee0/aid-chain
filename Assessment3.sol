    //decentralised identifiers (DIDs) by combining a role label like "transporter-" with the user's
    //aaddress in string form, creating something like "transporter-d9145cce523...". To do this,
    //toAsciiString takes each byte of the address, breaks it into two parts (called "nibbles"), and converts
    //each part into its corresponding character (like 'a', '5', 'f') - just like translating numbers into
    //hex. The helper char function does the actual conversion for each part. This process is important
    //because it guarantees that every DID is both unique (because Ethereum addresses are unique) and readable,
    //and can be used to link roles and look up registered users by DID.

    // Helper function to convert address to ASCII string
    //Converts an Ethereum address to a lowercase ASCII hex string (e.g., 0xABcD becomes "abcd").
    //This is useful for generating human-readable and unique DID strings tied to roles (e.g., "transporter-abc123..")
    //Solidity doesn't provide a native way to stringify address, so we implement this manually.

    function toAsciiString(address x) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        //Allocate a fixed-sized byte array of length 40 (each byte of an address becomes two hex characters)
        bytes memory s = new bytes(40);

        //Loop through each of the 20 bytes of the address
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            //isolate the i-th byte from the address using bitwise math
            //(uint160(x) converts address to a uint, then we shift right and mask)
            bytes1 b = bytes1(uint8(uint256(uint160(x)) / (2**(8 * (19 - i)))));

            //Split the byte into high and low 4-bit halves (nibbles)
            bytes1 hi = bytes1(uint8(b) / 16); //Most significant nibble

//*************************************INSTRUCTIONS***************************************
//Instructions, so you have to go to a different address put at least 1 eth in the value endpoint
//and click to donate to add eth into the contract - adding 1 eth will turn it into 3 contracts
//as the threshold for a token is like 0.32 eth and so then we would be up to the fourth one but it can't
//be issued until its full
//Complicated shi so we have to get the contract address of the AidToken Contract and then use
//it when we are deploying for the second contract AidTokenHandler - that way AidTokenHandler
//we be able to properly call the functions in AidToken
//So if there tokenId is 1 and you want to authenticate yourself as the ground relief
//You have to go onto the Ground Relief address and then type in 1 in the authenticate system


//The stuff below just confused me so i need a reminder of the pain it caused:
//when you use "At Address" in Remix, you're only telling the IDE "here’s the address 
//of a deployed contract" — but if that contract wasn’t deployed through your current 
//project code (or you didn’t import the correct interface), Remix can’t interact 
//with it properly. Deploying the second contract directly with the correct 
//AidToken address as its constructor input ensures it’s wired correctly from the start.


//**************************Explanation Stuff******************************
//There is probably a lot of stuff that should be explained better lol

// tokens 0, 1, and 2 are working for stakeholder authentication, but token 3 is not – 
//and that’s exactly what should happen based on the code. When a new token (e.g., token ID 3)
//is created during donation but hasn't yet met the donationThreshold (0.32 ETH), 
//the issueAidToken() function is not called. That means: aidTokens[3].isIssued == false
//You can assign stakeholders to that token ID, but they cannot authenticate themselves 
//until the token is officially issued. This prevents incomplete or underfunded tokens 
//from moving through the aid process - which makes sense for auditability and security.


//Location Stuff Explained/Validation stuff
//When a user registers in the DIDRegistry, they assign a location (e.g., "PNG", "FIJI", etc.).
//In the AidToken contract's assignAidRecipients function, you already validate:
//  - That the address has the correct role (transporter, ground relief, or recipient)
//  - That the prefix of the DID matches (e.g., "transporter-").
//  - That the location of the address matches the location inputted when assigning (require(keccak256(...))).
// Only if all of these validations pass do you allow the AidToken to be assigned to the tokenId.
// Once the AidToken is assigned, you store the location into the AidTokenData struct for that tokenId.

//In the AidTokenHandler contract:
//When moving through the delivery stages (authenticateTransferTeam, authenticateGroundRelief, claimAid):
//  - You already confirm that the caller's address matches the assigned address from the AidToken struct.
//  - You enforce correct delivery order: Issued -> InTransit -> Delivered -> Claimed.

//Do you need to re-validate location again in AidTokenHandler?
//Answer: No, you don't need to validate location again.
//Why?
//  - The location check already happened when assigning recipients in the AidToken contract.
//  - The tokenId itself is already attached to the correct location.
//  - When verifying and updating delivery status (in the Handler contract), you are only checking that the right 
//    address is acting at the right time.
//  - Adding another location check would just waste gas and unnecessarily complicate things.
